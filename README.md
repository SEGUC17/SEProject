this branch is our base project, what are going to do:
1) download this project on your machine
2) redirect to inside the src folder by typing in the terminal "cd ~/Desktop/SEProject/src", assuming the you downloaded the project on your desktop
3) type the command "npm install" to install any dependencies in the package.json file that you don't have on your machine

the final steps:
1) just copy paste your implemented methods  in their corresponding controllers and run them to see if their are any errors, the main controller will just contain the functions of the visitor.
2) make a branch with your functions on the new base on github with the name of your group, and I will integrate the three branches together with the new base.

I need the branches ready by tomorrow evening isa, if there is something wrong, tell me.

I changed the URL that connects the DB, I hope this fixes the previous error.

I also removed a require:true from the reviews schema, as it was not wroking with one of the members before, I redirected to the db folder and ran the command "node Reviews and it produced no errors, I hope this fixes the previous problem bardo.
